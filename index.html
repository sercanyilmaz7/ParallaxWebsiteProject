        the Panther tank was started by the Rheinmetall company in January 1943.

      <p class="par-2">
        Developed in 1953 in Switzerland, the first prototype of this tank
        featured a 90 mm gun. A second prototype with a British 20-pounder gun
        was built later. In the end, a series of 10 vehicles, featuring 105 mm
        guns, were produced and remained in service until 1964. After this, the
        vehicles were used as a basis for the Panzer 61. The only Panzer 58 that
        survives today features a 20-pounder gun and is currently located in the
        tank museum in Thun, Bern.

        From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, under the program for developing
        a new main battle tank, various designs were considered. One of them was
        a variant known as Concept 1B with a low turret and manual loading of a
        110 mm rifled gun with high ballistics. No metal prototype was produced.
